1) Clustering
  Clustering is a technique for exploring raw, unlabeled data and breaking it down into groups (or clusters) based on similarities or differences.
  It is used in a variety of applications, including customer segmentation, fraud detection, and image analysis.
  Clustering algorithms split data into natural groups by finding similar structures or patterns in uncategorized data.

  Here are some real-world unsupervised learning examples:
    Recommendation engines, Anomaly detection, Customer segmentation, Natural language processing (NLP),
    Genetic research, Fraud detection (revealing fraudulent transactions or unusual behavior like bot acitvity)
